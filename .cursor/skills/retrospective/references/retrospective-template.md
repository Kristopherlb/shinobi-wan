## The Golden Path (If It Existed)

_Describe what an ideal workflow would look like for this type of work._

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Step 1: [Ideal first step]                                         │
│  Outputs: [What would be produced]                                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              │
                              ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Step 2: [Ideal second step]                                        │
│  Outputs: [What would be produced]                                  │

## Key Takeaway

> **[Single sentence summarizing the most important learning from this work.]**

---

## Plan Alignment (Mandatory)

_What should change in the plan so the next run is easier and less error-prone?_

- Plan drift observed: [scope/order/assumptions that changed]
- Plan update(s) to apply next time: [copy/paste-ready text]
- New preflight steps to add: [scripts/tests/artifacts]

---

## Improvements / Capabilities That Would Help Next

_What tools/skills/generators/capabilities would have reduced friction or prevented mistakes?_

| Type | Proposal | Effort | Expected Impact |
|------|----------|--------|-----------------|
| Tooling | [e.g., debug wrapper, lint check, generator option] | [estimate] | [impact] |
| Skill/Docs | [e.g., update a skill, add a reference doc] | [estimate] | [impact] |
| Capability/Generator | [e.g., new capability, extend generator] | [estimate] | [impact] |

## Follow-Up Actions

After completing this retrospective:

- [ ] Update `/retrospectives/PATTERNS.md` with any recurring patterns
- [ ] Add recommendations to `/retrospectives/IMPROVEMENTS.md` with IDs
- [ ] Move this file to `/retrospectives/sessions/`
- [ ] Create skills/workflows for immediate recommendations (if applicable)
